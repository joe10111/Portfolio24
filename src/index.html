      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">The Level Up App</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        A innovative ASP.Net Core web application developed collaboratively over three weeks with my teammates Eli Paris and Rafi Wick, divided into three distinct sprints. 
        This platform enhances productivity through sophisticated task management and engaging gamification features. Users can maintain organized lists of tasks, customize 
        tasks aligned with their personal aspirations, and experience gamified progression by "leveling up" their account upon task completion. 
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-l font-semibold">Features and BackEnd</h2>
      <p class="text-white"> 
        One of the standout features is the AI-generated profile pictures, powered by OpenAI's API, which evolve to visually represent user progress, adding a unique motivational element. 
        Additionally, the dynamic radar graph offers a visual snapshot of weekly achievements, encouraging consistent user engagement through interactive feedback. 
        We developed the backend using C#.Net and ASP.Net Core, with PostgreSQL for database management, ensuring robust performance and scalability. 
        This project not only highlights my backend development skills but also demonstrates my ability to collaborate effectively within a team to turn everyday tasks into a captivating and rewarding experience.

      <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">About Me</h1>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        I'm Joseph, a passionate Backend Developer who recently completed The Launch Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. This innovative program, designed specifically for young career starters, deepened my expertise in C#/.NET, object-oriented programming, and databases, preparing me to tackle complex software development challenges with modern solutions.

        My journey doesn't end with software development; I'm also fervently exploring the realm of game development. Revisiting my foundational skills in C++ from my college days, I'm now engrossed in mastering Unreal Engine 5. My ambition is to blend my technical abilities with creative storytelling, crafting engaging worlds that offer players unique and memorable experiences.
        
        Outside of the digital domain, my adventures in the Pacific Northwest's wilderness, time spent with my cats, and the art of coffee brewing enrich my life. These experiences, combined with the invaluable customer service skills I developed as a Starbucks Barista, have shaped my approach to technology and teamwork.
        
        With a balanced skill set in both C#/.NET for software development and C++ for game creation, I am eager to contribute to meaningful projects in both spheres. I invite you to explore my portfolio further. Let's discuss how we can work together to bring innovative ideas to life.
