      <h2>The Level Up App</h2>
      <p>
        A innovative ASP.Net Core web application developed collaboratively over three weeks with my teammates Eli Paris and Rafi Wick, divided into three distinct sprints. 
        This platform enhances productivity through sophisticated task management and engaging gamification features. Users can maintain organized lists of tasks, customize 
        tasks aligned with their personal aspirations, and experience gamified progression by "leveling up" their account upon task completion. 
      </p>
      <h2>Features and BackEnd</h2>
      <p> 
        One of the standout features is the AI-generated profile pictures, powered by OpenAI's API, which evolve to visually represent user progress, adding a unique motivational element. 
        Additionally, the dynamic radar graph offers a visual snapshot of weekly achievements, encouraging consistent user engagement through interactive feedback. 
        We developed the backend using C#.Net and ASP.Net Core, with PostgreSQL for database management, ensuring robust performance and scalability. 
        This project not only highlights my backend development skills but also demonstrates my ability to collaborate effectively within a team to turn everyday tasks into a captivating and rewarding experience.
