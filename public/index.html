        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4 mr-44">
          A innovative ASP.Net Core web application developed collaboratively over three weeks with my teammates Eli Paris and Rafi Wick, divided into three distinct sprints. 
          This platform enhances productivity through sophisticated task management and engaging gamification features. Users can maintain organized lists of tasks, customize 
          tasks aligned with their personal aspirations, and experience gamified progression by "leveling up" their account upon task completion. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-l font-semibold mb-2 mt-20">Features</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4 mr-44"> 
          AI-Generated Profile Pictures: One of the standout features of Level Up is the AI-generated profile pictures. Using OpenAI's powerful API, these images evolve to visually represent user progress over time. This unique approach not only personalizes the experience but also serves as a motivational tool, encouraging users to continue engaging with the app and tracking their development.

          Dynamic Radar Graph: To further enhance user interaction, Level Up includes a dynamic radar graph that provides a visual summary of weekly achievements. This feature allows users to quickly assess their progress and areas for improvement, promoting regular interaction and sustained engagement with the platform.

        <h2 class="text-l font-semibold mb-2 mt-20">BackEnd</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4 mr-44">
Backend Technology: The backbone of Level Up is built using C#.Net and ASP.Net Core, technologies chosen for their reliability and scalability. This robust framework supports the intricate features of the application while ensuring a smooth user experience.
Database Management: PostgreSQL was selected for database management due to its powerful capabilities and scalability. It effectively handles the complex data needs of Level Up, ensuring data integrity and fast query responses, which are crucial for maintaining an excellent user experience.

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-white">
          I'm Joseph, a passionate Backend Developer who recently completed The Launch Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. This innovative program, designed specifically for young career starters, deepened my expertise in C#/.NET, object-oriented programming, and databases, preparing me to tackle complex software development challenges with modern solutions.
    
          My journey doesn't end with software development; I'm also fervently exploring the realm of game development. Revisiting my foundational skills in C++ from my college days, I'm now engrossed in mastering Unreal Engine 5. My ambition is to blend my technical abilities with creative storytelling, crafting engaging worlds that offer players unique and memorable experiences.
          
          Outside of the digital domain, my adventures in the Pacific Northwest's wilderness, time spent with my cats, and the art of coffee brewing enrich my life. These experiences, combined with the invaluable customer service skills I developed as a Starbucks Barista, have shaped my approach to technology and teamwork.
          
          With a balanced skill set in both C#/.NET for software development and C++ for game creation, I am eager to contribute to meaningful projects in both spheres. I invite you to explore my portfolio further. Let's discuss how we can work together to bring innovative ideas to life.
